# Facial-Expression-Recognition
# Facial Expression Recognition Web App

A browser-based real-time facial expression recognition application built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
The app uses a pretrained deep-learning model to detect facial expressions from a live webcam feed and identifies **Happy, Sad, and Surprised** expressions.

The entire system runs **client-side in the browser** — no backend, no data storage, and no server-side processing.

  - 😊 Happy
  - 😢 Sad
  - 😮 Surprised
  etc

- Instant visual feedback with confidence percentage
- Fully client-side (privacy-friendly)
- No installation required beyond a browser
- Lightweight and easy to deploy

## ▶️ How to Run Locally

Because browsers restrict webcam access, the app **must be run via a local server**.

### Step 1: Navigate to the project folder
```bash
cd facial-expression
````

### Step 2: Start a local server

```bash
python -m http.server
```

### Step 3: Open in browser

```
http://localhost:8000
```

Use **Google Chrome** or **Microsoft Edge** for best results.

## 🔐 Permissions

* Allow **camera access** when prompted by the browser.
* Ensure no other applications (Zoom, Teams, OBS) are using the webcam.

---

## 🎯 Usage Instructions

1. Position your face clearly in front of the camera.
2. Ensure good lighting (front-facing light works best).
3. Change facial expressions naturally:

   * Smile → Happy
   * Frown → Sad
   * Open eyes wide / raised eyebrows → Surprised
4. The detected expression and confidence will update in real time.

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

* Accuracy depends on lighting, camera quality, and face visibility.
* Works best with a single face in the frame.
* Not intended for medical, psychological, or surveillance use.
* Browser-based AI has performance limits compared to native applications.

---

## 🛡️ Privacy

* No images or video are stored.
* No data is sent to any server.
* All processing happens locally in the browser.

---

## 📌 Future Enhancements

* Confidence visualization (progress bars)
* Face bounding box overlay
* Support for additional expressions
* Mobile responsiveness
* Chrome extension version
